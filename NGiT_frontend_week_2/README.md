# What I Learned This Week
- The web works by: browser → requests HTML from server → server sends HTML → browser reads and displays it.
- HTML is the **structure** CSS is the **style** and JavaScript is **behaviour**
- Block elements: p, h1-h6, ul, ol, li (new line + full width)
- Inline elements: a, img, span, strong, em, b, i (stay in line)
- You can style directly with style="..." (color, background, border, border-radius)
- Favorite new style tricks: border, border-radius, rounded images, colored boxes

## Project Description
This is my Week 2 submission for the NGIT Frontend Development track.  
I created a simple personal introduction page using **only HTML** 
It includes:
- Headings of different levels
- A profile image
- A short about section
- A list of current skills
- A summary of what I learned this week

## Most Useful Tags This Week
These tags helped me structure the page clearly and meaningfully:
- `<h1>` → Main title of the page (should be used only once)
- `<h2>` → Section titles (very useful for organizing content)
- `<img>` → Adding images with important accessibility text
- `<p>` → Writing paragraphs
- `<ul>` + `<li>` → Creating clean bullet lists
- `<br>` → Line break
